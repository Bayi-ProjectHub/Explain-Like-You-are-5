# AGENTS.md
This file provides instructions and information for coding agent when working on this project. 

## Project Context
*Explain Like You're 5 (讲解师)* is a student-led project for fun, not a serious commercial software where thousands of users request in the meantime.
The project aims to help users improve their autonomous learning, explanation, and presentation skills through short learning and presentation tasks.

## Architecture and Pipeline
This project is in its very early developing stage for now. The roadmap isn't fixed.

The initial idea is: pick a term -> user do research under given time -> record and upload a video of user explaining the term ->  evaluate and give advice based on the video. 

The current goal is building 3 main modules: audio processing and transcribing, text processing and evaluating, video processing and evaluating.

## Engineering
1. Keep It Simple — Prefer straightforward implementations over unnecessary abstractions or complex architectures.
2. Be pragmatic
3. Modular Design — Keep audio, text, and video processing modules logically independent.

## Development Guidelines

### Before Making Changes
1. Read relevant documentation
2. Inspect the existing implementation and understand the current module boundaries.

### Implementation Principles
1. Prioritize readability for humans. Avoid overly concise or abstract expressions that make code difficult to understand.
2. Add type hints where appropriate.
3. Write comments for non-obvious logic, design decisions, or variables. Use Chinese or English as appropriate.
4. Keep configuration separate from source code.
5. Never hardcode API keys, tokens, or other credentials.
6. Handle expected errors explicitly
7. Stay within the requested scope, reuse existing code where appropriate, and avoid unrelated refactoring.
8. Design Consistency: Follow existing project conventions and architecture. Explain significant design decisions when necessary.

### After Making Changes
1. Run relevant tests or checks to verify the implementation.
2. Report what was changed and any known limitations.
3. Identify any changes to shared interfaces, dependencies, or architecture.
4. Update relevant documentation (including this file AGENTS.md) to reflect the actual implementation and any changed interfaces or decisions.
